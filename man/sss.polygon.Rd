\title{Draws a Simple Systematic Sample (SSS) from an area resource (polygons).}
\usage{
sss.polygon(x, n, spacing = c(1, 1), triangular = FALSE, rand.dir = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{SpatialPolygons} or \code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame} 
object. This object
must contain at least 1 polygon.  If it contains more than 1 polygon, the
SSS sample is drawn from the union of all polygons.  Holes are respected.}

\item{n}{Sample size.  Number of locations to draw from the union of all
polygons contained in \code{x}.}

\item{spacing}{A vector of length 2 containing the RELATIVE spacing of grid
points in the horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) directions.  See details.}

\item{triangular}{Boolean scalar specifying whether to produce a rectangular
(\code{triangular==FALSE}) or triangular (\code{triangular==TRUE}) grid. 
See Details.}

\item{rand.dir}{Either a boolean scalar specifying whether to randomly 
orient the
grid's horizontal axis (\code{rand.dir==TRUE}) or not 
(\code{rand.dir==FALSE}), or
a user-specified fixed direction for the horizontal axis.  If
FALSE, orientation of the grid is parallel to the X and Y axes.  If TRUE,
the X axis of the grid is randomly rotated by an angle between -pi/4 
(-45 degrees) and pi/4 (45 degrees).  
If \code{rand.dir} is a number, the 
grid is rotated by that many radians. No range check is performed 
on user-specified \code{rand.dir}, so for example, rotation by \code{pi/8} is 
equivalent to rotation by \code{pi/8 + 2*pi}. User-specified, but random, 
direction of the grid can be specified by \code{rand.dir = runif(1,0,pi)}.
Note, relative spacing 
of the grid cells is computed prior to rotation.}
}
\value{
A \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame} containing locations in the SSS sample, 
in row-wise order starting in the south (see \code{sampleID}, \code{row}, \code{col} 
in returned data frame).  Attributes of the sample points (in the 
embedded data frame) are 
as follows: 
\itemize{
  \item \code{sampleID}: A unique identifier for every sample point.  For 
  rectangular grids, \code{sampleID} is incremented west to east by row from 
  the south.  For triangular grids, \code{sampleID} is assigned west to east 
  to points in every other row from the south. Then, 
  starts over in the southwest and assigns ID's to previously-skipped 
  rows.
  \item \code{row}: Row number of the sampled point in the grid.  Row numbers 
  are the vertical indices of the grid in a direction perpendicular to 
  the (potentially rotated) main horizontal axis. Cell (1,1) is in 
  the lower left (southwest) corner of the shape's bounding box.
  Thus, row 1 is defined 
  along the lower (southern) boundary of the shape's bounding box.  
  Points in row 1 may not be inside the shape and therefore 
  may not appear in the sample.  Consequently, the lowest row appearing 
  in the sample may not be 1.  Visualize row i with 
  \code{points(samp[samp$row==i,])}. 
  \item \code{col}: Column number of the sampled point in the grid. Column 
  numbers are the horizontal indices of the grid in a direction parallel to
  the (potentially rotated) main horizontal axis. Cell (1,1) is in 
  the lower left (southwest) corner of the shape's bounding box.
  Thus, column 1 is defined 
  along the left (western) boundary of the shape's bounding box.  
  Points in column 1 may not be inside the shape and therefore 
  may not appear in the sample.  Consequently, the lowest column appearing 
  in the sample may not be 1. Visualize column i with 
  \code{points(samp[samp$col==i,])}.   
  \item \code{geometryID}: The ID of the polygon in \code{x} which each 
  sample point falls.  The 
  ID of polygons in \code{x} are \code{row.names(geometry(x))}. 
  \item Any attributes of the original polygons (in \code{x}). 
}

Additional attributes of the output object, beyond those which 
make it a \code{SpatialPointsDataFrame}, are:
\itemize{
   \item \code{frame}: Name of the input sampling frame.
   \item \code{frame.type}: Type of resource in sampling frame. (i.e., "polygon").
   \item \code{sample.type}: Type of sample drawn. (i.e., "SSS").

   \item \code{spacing.m}: A vector of length 2 giving the dimensions of
   cells in units of the coordinates of \code{x}. (e.g., meters).  This
   is the final \code{delta} computed above.  Each cell has size 
   \code{prod(spacing.m)} = Area / \code{n}.
   
   \item \code{rand.dir}: The (potentially randomly chosen) direction for the grid's 
   horizontal axis. This is in radians between -pi/4 and pi/4. 
   \code{rand.dir} = 0 corresponds to no rotation 
   (i.e., \code{rand.dir =} \code{FALSE}).  
   
   \item \code{rand.shift}: The random shift of the grid.  This is a vector 
   of length 2 containing the  random shifts in the horizontal and vertical 
   directions before rotation.  The random shift in both directions 
   is chosen between 0 and the corresponding element of the \code{spacing.m}
   attribute (described above).
   
   
   \item \code{triangular}: TRUE or FALSE depending on whether the output 
   grid is triangular or rectangular, respectively.

\description{
Draws a systematic, or grid, sample from a \code{SpatialPolygons} or 
\code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame} object.  Optional parameters control
control the relative spacing in horizontal and vertical directions, whether
a square or triangular grid is produced, and whether the grid baseline has 
random orientation.
}
\details{
The projection system of the input shape object (\code{x}) is 
not considered. But, a projected coordinate system is necessary to 
obtain correct spacing on the ground.  
The author STRONGLY recommends converting \code{x} to a UTM coordinate
system prior to calling this function.

Spacing (size and shape of grid cells) is determined by \code{n} and 
\code{spacing}. If \code{spacing} is not given,
grid spacing is equal in X and Y directions, which produces square grid
cells.  In this case, grid spacing is \code{delta} 
(= \code{sqrt(A/n)}, where
\code{A} = area of union of all polygons in \code{x}.

Relative shape of grid cells is controlled by the \code{spacing} vector.  If
\code{spacing = c(rx, ry)}, spacing in X and Y directions is
\code{spacing*delta/rev(spacing)}, where \code{delta} 
= \code{sqrt(A/n)}. Conceptually, a square cell of size \code{delta^2} 
is "stretched" multiplicatively by \code{rx} in the X direction and \code{ry} in the 
Y direction. After stretching, the area of each cell remains
\code{delta^2} while the relative lengths of the (rectangular) cell 
sides is 1 to \code{(ry/rx)^2}.  That is, vertical dimension of each cell 
is \code{(ry/rx)^2} times the horizontal dimension.  Vice versa, the horizontal 
dimension is \code{(rx/ry)^2} times the vertical.

In general, realized sample size is not fixed.  Across multiple calls,
realized sample size will not always equal \code{n}.  Across an infinite number
of calls, the average sample size will be \code{n}


In all cases, the grid is randomly shifted in the X and Y directions, 
before rotation (if called for).  The amount of the random shift is 
less than the X and Y extent of cells, and is returned as an attribute 
of the sample.
