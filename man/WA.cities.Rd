\title{SpatialPointsDataFrame of cities in Washington state, USA}
\format{
A SpatialPointsDataFrame containing one point for each of 815 cities in Washington state. Source
of the Shapefile from which these cities were queried is
\url{http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/atlasftp.html}  (file 'citiesx010g.shp.tar.gz'). 

The attributes of each point are:
\enumerate{
\item GNIS_ID = A unique identification number assigned by the Geographic Names
Information System (GNIS).  This number can be used to link places in this data set
with GNIS.
\item ANSICODE =  A unique identification number assigned by the U.S. Census Bureau.  This
number can be used to link places in this data set with the Census Gazetteer data.
\item FEATURE = The type of feature, as assigned by GNIS. Values are 'Census', 'Civil',
and 'Populated Place'.  
\item FEATURE2 = The status of the city or town. Values are -999 (missing), 'County Seat',
and 'State Capital County Seat'.
\item NAME = The name of the city or town.
\item POP_2010 =  The 2010 population of the city or town.  Locations with a population of
0 are listed as such in the Census source data.
\item COUNTY = The name of the county or county equivalent where the city or town is
located.
\item COUNTYFIPS = The 3-digit FIPS code of the county or county equivalent.
\item STATE = The 2-character abbreviation for the State in which the city or town is
located. Values are 'WA'.
\item STATE_FIPS = The 2-digit FIPS code for the State in which the city or town is
located.
\item LATITUDE = The latitude of the city or town as it appears in this data set.
\item LONGITUDE = The longitude of the city or town as it appears in this data set.
\item PopPlLat = The latitude of the city or town as it appears in the source data.
\item PopPlLong = The longitude of the city or town as it appears in the source data.
\item ELEV_IN_M = The elevation, in meters, of the city or town.  Determined from GNIS or
from topographic map sources.
\item ELEV_IN_FT = The elevation, in feet, of the city or town.  Determined from GNIS or
from topographic map sources.
