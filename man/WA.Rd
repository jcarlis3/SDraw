\title{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame for the state of Washington, USA}
\format{
A SpatialPolygonsDataFrame containing 50 polygons whose union outline 
boundaries of the state of Washington. Source of the Shapefile from which these 
polygons were queried is 
\url{http://nationalmap.gov/small_scale/atlasftp.html}  (file 'statesp020.tar.gz').

Attributes of the polygons are:
\enumerate{
 \item  AREA = Size of the polygon in square kilometers.  
 \item  PERIMETER = The perimeter of polygon in kilometers. 
 \item  STATESP020 = Internal feature number
 \item  STATE = The name of the State or State equivalent.
 \item  STATE_FIPS = The 2-digit FIPS code of the State or State equivalent.
 \item  ORDER_ADM =  An ordinal value indicating the State's order of admission to the United States.
 \item  MONTH_ADM = The month when the State was admitted to the United States.
 \item  DAY_ADM = The day when the State was admitted to the United States.
 \item  YEAR_ADM = The year when the State was admitted to the United States.
 \item  LAND_TYPE = Type of the polygon. Types are "ISLAND", "MAINLAND", "OCEAN"
}

The proj4string is \code{+proj=utm +zone=10 +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0}, 
meaning among other things that the coordinates are projected zone 10 UTM's in meters. 
The rectangular bounding box of all polygons is
